percentify
==========

Percentify is a tool to help teachers mark tests.

A common nuisance of marking is that you have a bunch of tests with scores such as 34/40 which you then have to convert to percentages so that they can be recorded on a student's report.

In order to avoid having to do these calculations by hand, it would help to have a chart that gives you the corresponding percentage for every test score. For example, at a glance, you could see that 34/40 is equal to 85%. Percentify generates such a chart.
